# Disclaimer:
**I did not create and do not maintain this project!** *(at least not at the moment)*

This project belongs to [jaysoo](https://github.com/jaysoo/react-native-prompt) and is a fork from [lightman73's](https://github.com/lightman73/react-native-prompt) fork that includes changes to remove the prop-types error.
This fork is only and only because the original package is not maintained anymore and i wanted to publish it to use it with my projects.

Feel free to use it, and if the community wants the package to be maintained from this repo, it's all fine by me.
